# PURPOSE OF PROJECT

This project downloads the S&P500 stock index data from the default data source
used by the get.hist.quote function that is part of the tseries data and examines
the effect of increasing decay factors on a plot of that data.

# COPYRIGHT INFO

This project was generated for Southern Methodist University course MSDS 6306
Doing Data Science: An Introduction to Data Science to complete Homework 11.

*Datasets sources*

Data downloadeded using get.hist.quote function default source for the R tseries
package.

# FILE ORGANIZATION

____ <- signifies a folder (i.e. data <- = data folder)

"|" separates multiple files in the same folder (i.e. GDP.csv | EDDATA.csv) 

The original file structure is as follows:

  + ReadME.md

  + Makefile.txt

  + paper <-NShaver_DDS_HW11.Rmd

*After running the Makefile in the command line...*

The file structure should be as follows:

  + ReadME.md
  
  + Makefile.txt
  
  + paper <- NShaver_DDS_HW11.Rmd | NShaver_DDS_HW11.html | 
  NShaver_DDS_HW11.md | NShaver_DDS_HW11_files
             
    + NShaver_DDS_HW11_files <- figure-markdown_github <- plots-1.png
